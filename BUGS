Snake: List of know bugs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Snake can only be 4000 chars long.

	The snake can only be 4000 chars long. No checking is done to see if
	it has grown any larger. This is because normally the screen is only
	80 x 25 chars. But xterms can be bigger than that. The result is
	unknown to me, but a segfault is probable.

2.	Snake tail routine not optimal

        Snake tail routine is not optimal. Therefor an extra segment is
        shortly visible when the snake grows. There's also a blank character
	visible at the starting point of the snake, whenever the snake grows.
	I know why this happens, but I'm too lazy to fix it.
